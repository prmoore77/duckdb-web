This repository hosts the source code for the [DuckDB Website](www.duckdb.org). Please file any  questions or issues relating to the website or documentation here.

The main DuckDB repository is hosted [here](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb).


## Building
The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). To build the site locally, install ruby, and run `bundler` to install the dependencies. If you are on Windows, you must then run these two commands: 
```
gem uninstall eventmachine
gem install eventmachine --platform ruby
```
You might have to install `webrick` to get `jekyll serve` to work, you can do so by running `gem install webrick`.  
Finally, navigate to the directory where you have cloned duckdb-web and run `bundler exec jekyll serve`. The website can then be browsed by going to `localhost:4000` in your browser.

## Generating code docs

Much of the documentation in this repository is automatically generated from the duckdb source code, or compiled binaries. The scripts that do this work are called from [`scripts/generate_all_docs.sh`](scripts/generate_all_docs.sh)
